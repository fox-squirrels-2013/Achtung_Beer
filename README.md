## Git Workflow:

* Branch features from testing branch
* Branch individual branches from features branch
* Unless absolutely necessary, never push spike branches to remote. Instead, integrate spike features into individual branches, then push to features. 
* Only push features branches if they're complete, including passing tests
* Only push to master if it's in the testing branch and everything passes.
